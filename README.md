## U-Net GANVoxForge: Next-Gen 3D Synthesis

U-Net GANVoxForge is an advanced 3D transformation tool that harnesses the power of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with U-Net architecture to convert 2D images into highly detailed and accurate 3D voxel models.

### Architecture Rationale

The choice of using a GAN with U-Net architecture offers significant advantages over other potential methods. Some of these advantages include:

 - High-quality 3D models: GANs are known for generating high-quality and realistic results in various image synthesis tasks. By combining GANs with U-Net architecture, our model can generate detailed 3D voxel models with high fidelity and structural coherence, closely resembling the ground truth.

 - Context-aware image-to-image translation: U-Net architecture is designed to capture and preserve local and global contextual information from input images. This is achieved by utilizing skip connections between the encoder and decoder sub-networks. These connections allow the model to transfer spatial information from the input image to the generated 3D voxel model effectively, resulting in more accurate and context-aware 3D representations.

 - Robustness to dataset variations: The U-Net GANVoxForge can handle various datasets with diverse shapes and complexities. The architecture is capable of learning and generalizing well across different object categories, making it a versatile solution for 3D voxel model generation tasks.

 - Efficient training: The U-Net architecture, with its skip connections and relatively shallow depth, enables efficient training compared to other deep generative models. This results in faster convergence and less resource-intensive training processes.

 - Overall, the U-Net GANVoxForge provides a powerful and efficient solution for 2D-to-3D voxel model generation, offering high-quality results and adaptability to a wide range of applications in computer vision, graphics, and beyond.

### Installation
#### Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/username/VoxMorpher.git`

`cd VoxMorpher`

####Set up a virtual environment (optional, but recommended):

`python -m venv venv`
`source venv/bin/activate`  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

#### Install the required packages:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Dataset Preparation

 - Download the dataset (e.g., ShapeNet, ModelNet, or any custom dataset) containing 2D images and corresponding 3D voxel models.
 - Organize the dataset into two directories: 2d_images and 3d_voxels.
 - Update the `config.py` file to reflect the dataset's path, image size, and voxel resolution.
 
 
### Training

To train the model, run the following command:

`python main.py --train`
This will train the generator and discriminator models using the dataset specified in `config.py`. Checkpoints will be saved in the checkpoints directory.

You can customize the training parameters such as learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, etc., by modifying the `config.py` file.

### Evaluation

To evaluate the trained generator on a test dataset, run the following command:

`python main.py --evaluate`

This will calculate the `mean squared error (MSE)` between the generated 3D voxel models and the ground truth.

### Visualization

To visualize the generated 3D voxel models, run the following command:

`python main.py --visualize`

This will display the input 2D images and the corresponding generated 3D voxel models.
